Keep an eye on https://github.com/Tpt/oxigraph!
  It looks like it might be the thing to use once stable.
  But no support for FROM NAMED yet :(

which RDF crate(s)? rio, rome, sophia?

Can you use the existing linked data signatures spec?
https://w3c-dvcg.github.io/ld-signatures/
It doesn't seem quite ready yet, but is probably the right way long term.

Does the graph have to be named just the public key, or should it include something readable?

Should the triples be stored in signed form, or just marked "OK" after the initial check?
If storing signed, the entries need to be saved as-is before parsing.

Should signatures be done separately using GPG or similar, or via Enigma.js?

Should anon's private key be required to execute a query?

How should signatures be used? Do they go in the predicates or separate?

Better name? sigdb, anondb, witsec, secret turtle, he-said-she-said, assert(ive)...

Does this relate to/integrate with keybase?

Simpler example: DMV verfies things itself first?

Do queries have to be signed by the entities involved?

What about N-quads?

Is the unique human identity thing really required?
Where does the DMV's signature get encoded?

Is it possible to execute an arbitrary function/program as a predicate?
Something like <person1> nebula:cousin <person2>.
