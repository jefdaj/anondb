which RDF crate(s)? rio, rome, sophia?

Does the graph have to be named just the public key, or should it include something readable?

Should anon's private key be required to execute a query?

How should signatures be used? Do they go in the predicates or separate?

Better name? sigdb, anondb, witsec, secret turtle, he-said-she-said, assert(ive)...

Does this relate to/integrate with keybase?

Simpler example: DMV verfies things itself first?

Do queries have to be signed by the entities involved?

What about N-quads?

Is the unique human identity thing really required?
Where does the DMV's signature get encoded?

Is it possible to execute an arbitrary function/program as a predicate?
Something like <person1> nebula:cousin <person2>.
